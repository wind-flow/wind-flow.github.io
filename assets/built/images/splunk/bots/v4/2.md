- Most Important BOTS V4 Sourcetypes

Whenever you encounter a new Splunk instance it is a great time to try the Splunk command metadata. This can show you all the hosts, sources, and sourcetypes in a system. In the example below we show sourcetypes that exist in the Boss of the SOC dataset:

The sourcetypes for “Boss of the SOC” center around a few major types of tools that we use to collect data on hosts; primarily the following:

Windows
This is the default Windows-TA for Splunk and collects not only EventLog data but also registry information. Pay special attention to Windows Security (4688!!!) and Windows registry. We've written lots about hunting with Windows Logs. Check out this great one from Tom Smit: Peeping through Windows Logs or one that Ryan Kovar wrote on Powershell hunting and event code 4688: Hells Bells lets hunt PowerShells
Sysmon
This TA collects information generated from the Sysmon tool. It (slightly confusingly) is under the sourcetype XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational. We should note, that We LOVE sysmon. In fact, John Stoner wrote a great blog on it! Read up on Sysmon here: A Salacious Soliloquy on Sysmon.
Stream
Stream is Splunk’s wiredata collection/creation tool. It can capture a wide variety of traffic (including PCAPS and payloads!) on a network and turn them into wire metadata that is ingested into Splunk. The sourcetype is broken out into all of the captured/detected protocols (i.e. stream:dns, stream:http). In this exercise, we have turned on every possible option for Stream so that you can experience the full awesomeness of the tool. We especially recommend looking at stream for these following protocols: http, tcp, smtp, ftp, and dns.
This should give you a good place to start when working with the BOTS data set but remember, there are over 100 sourcetypes and you may find others of interest as you start looking for answers!
