scenario-1

After three years of running Boss of the SOC, we’ve learned a couple things. The biggest thing is that not everyone has the same level of knowledge about Splunk, Splunk tools, CTFs or security as everyone else. These first questions in the 100 series are designed to be warm-ups. They are basic questions so you can get familiar with the different tools in Splunk (like UBA, ES, and Phantom), learn the primary flow of a CTF, and have points on the board. You will not win BOTS by only answering the questions in the 100 series, but you may lose it if you don’t answer them at all. Good luck!

scenario-2
ThirstyBerner Red Team (2XX)
![]({{site.url}}/assets/built/images/bots/v4/v4-ctflogo.png)
The CFO of Frothly, Billy Tun, is performing due diligence for the ThirstyBerner acquisition. As part of this, he decides to hire a security company to perform an unannounced penetration test of the ThirstyBerner information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) networks. In this scenario, you need to answer questions about all aspects of the penetration test and some other "reddish-purple" activities.
While Billy is great with numbers, it turns out he's not so hot at computer security or even just following instructions. He also has a strange tendency to use the phrase MoBeerMoMoney! all the time.
Some of Billy's correspondence with the security company is located here, but you'll need to be pretty good if you want to read it.

Scenario 3 - APT Attack (3XX)

It's one of those days for Grace and team at Frothly. The good news is that it looks like Taedonggang has left the building, but with their acquistion of Thirsty Berner Brewery, it appears they have attracted the attention of a new threat group called the Violent Memmes. To complicate things further, Frothly hasn't fully transitioned Thirsty Berner to their Azure/O365 infrastructure. Alice has obtained an indicator that she has loaded into ES that might provide a place to start. Additionally, Alice has desktops and servers logs and has added additional logging including PowerShell, Windows Defender and Carbon Black as well as Azure AD and Office365 logs and more at her disposal. Luckily she updated ES and has recently upgraded Frothly with UBA and Phantom. The tools are loaded with alerts, and she just needs to dig in!

Scenario 4 - Brewery Industrial Control (4XX)

When Frothly acquired Thirsty Berner Brewery, there were only two people left employed: CEO/founder Audrey Grady and Master Brewer Mateo Valitus. Audrey was overjoyed by the acquisition because it meant that her dream could keep going, but Mateo seemed distraught. Several weeks after Frothly took over the Thirsty Berner network, Audrey called Grace to complain about how her systems went crazy and ruined a batch of beer. Grace immediately called the Frothly Security team, who found some suspicious activity in the Brewery's OT network! They hadn't really worked with ICS or SCADA data before, but in between Suricata, Zeek, Dragos, and PCAPS, they were positive that the case could be solved.
